## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**:

  - Next.js
  - React
  - Tailwind CSS
  - Axios (for API requests)

- **Backend**:

  - MongoDB (NoSQL database)
  - Express.js
  - Node.js

- **Hosting**:
  - Vercel (for frontend deployment)
  - MongoDB Atlas (for cloud database hosting)

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following installed:

1. **Node.js**: Download from [here](https://nodejs.org/).
2. **MongoDB Atlas Account**: Create an account to host your database. [Create an Atlas account](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas).

### Backend Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/gifthub.git
   cd gifthub
   ```
````

2. Install dependencies for the backend:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root of your project to store your MongoDB connection string:

   ```
   MONGO_URI=your-mongodb-uri
   ```

4. Start the backend server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Frontend Setup

1. Change to the frontend directory:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies for the frontend:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the frontend:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Visit the application at `http://localhost:3000`.

## How It Works

- **User Search**: When a user enters a search term, the frontend makes an API request to the backend, which queries the MongoDB database for matching gifts.
- **Filter Functionality**: Users can filter gifts based on categories, price ranges, and specific occasions.
- **Dynamic Display**: Gift results are dynamically displayed on the frontend using React components, styled with Tailwind CSS for a responsive design.

## Database Schema

The project utilizes MongoDB to store gift data. Below are the key fields in the database:

- **gift_name**: The name of the gift.
- **price**: The price of the gift.
- **category**: The category the gift belongs to (e.g., toys, electronics).
- **tags**: Keywords associated with the gift (e.g., "new year", "thank you").
- **age**: Age group suitable for the gift.
- **occasion**: The occasion the gift is intended for (e.g., Birthday, Christmas).
- **purchase_link**: A URL to buy the gift.
- **gift_description**: A short description of the gift.
- **recipient_name**: The name of the intended recipient.
- **shipping_address**: The shipping address for the gift.

2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature-name`).
3. Make your changes.
4. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add feature'`).
5. Push to your fork (`git push origin feature-name`).
